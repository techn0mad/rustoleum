I know you discounted the language - but attached is a solution in PHP.

It has the added benefit of error detection & reporting, plus will
also accept URLs in addition to file names.

e.g.
% ./answer https://github.com/techn0mad/rustoleum/raw/master/README

now, will you retract your statement about PHP not being a scripting
language? :-)
